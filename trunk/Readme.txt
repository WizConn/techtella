Techtella is a basic program written in C# to allow file sharing across multiple computers. 
It creates a small network that facilitates the tranactions.

Requirements:
Techtella has only been tested on a computer with basic specifications running Windows XP. As such, the only thing one should need is a Windows XP operating system and a connection to the internet.

Basic Use/Instructions:

Run Techtella.exe. At the upper left hand corner, a button named Connections should be visibile. Click this and a new window will appear. In this window, a text entry bar will appear. Input the IP address to the known peer that you want to connect to(one's own IP address can be inputted to simply start the program). After this one will have access to the basic abilities of Chatting with known peers and file sharing. The Shared Files tab is where one can notify to the rest of the community that a certain file, divided amoung 3 catagories: Type, Name, File Name, is avaialable to download. The Search tab allows one to search for files that are shared by other memeber of the network. Connections list both known peers and found peers through the known peers. The Transfers tab shows the different downlaods and uploads that are proceeding on your computer. The Chat tab allows one to chat with different users on the network. To do this, one simply clicks on the IP address that one wishes type to and presses the send button. The Statistics tab shows basic information such as how many files one has downloaded and how many pings one has received. The Help button at the top shows basic information about those who created this project. Any questions should be pointed at them.
